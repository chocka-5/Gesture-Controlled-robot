A gesture controlled robot is controlled by using hand in place of any other method like buttons or joystick. Here one only needs to move hand to control the robot. A transmitting device is used in your hand which contains RF Transmitter and accelero-meter. This will transmit command to robot so that it can do the required task like moving forward, reverse, turning left, turning right and stop. All these tasks will be performed by using hand gesture.
